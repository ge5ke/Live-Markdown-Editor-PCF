## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-22

**Breaking release.** This is a v3 overhaul focused on correctness, honesty, and weight —
several features and one manifest property were removed rather than fixed in place.

### Breaking

- **`theme` property removed from the manifest.** The control is light-only now; makers who
  had `theme` set to `dark`, `auto`, or `high-contrast` will see that configuration dropped
  on upgrade. There is no runtime theme switching or OS dark-mode following anymore.
- **Find & Replace removed** (panel UI, `useFindReplace` hook, global Ctrl+F capture).
- **Save-status indicator removed** (the "Saved/Saving/Unsaved" badge never reflected the
  actual record save and was misleading).

### Changed

- **Notify-on-blur value flow.** The bound `value` output now updates when focus leaves the
  control (or on teardown), not continuously per keystroke. Typing no longer dirties the
  host form mid-edit; a synchronous flush on blur/destroy guarantees the latest content is
  handed to the platform before a Save-button click can read it. Ctrl+S while focus remains
  inside the editor does not itself trigger a flush (it still blurs the field elsewhere in
  the platform's own save flow).
- **Read-only mode is now a true non-editable renderer.** `readOnly = true` configures the
  underlying ProseMirror view as genuinely non-editable (not just visually disabled), hides
  all toolbar/status chrome, and renders only the formatted markdown.
- **`maxLength` is now hard-enforced**, not advisory: input beyond the limit is blocked at
  the editor level rather than merely flagged after the fact. The metric is text length
  (`doc.textContent`), which can diverge from the serialized markdown byte count for content
  with heavy syntax (tables, links, code fences). Makers should set `maxLength` with some
  headroom below the bound Dataverse column's configured max length, not exactly at it.
- **Scroll behavior: click-to-interact.** The editor no longer captures page scroll on
  hover; the inner pane only scrolls once it has focus, so mouse-wheel scrolling over the
  control while the page scrolls past it now behaves like a normal form field.
- **Corner rendering fixed** so all four corners round correctly regardless of which
  chrome (toolbar/status bar) is present — previously read-only mode (and any config with
  `showToolbar = false`) squared off the top corners in model-driven forms.
- **URL validation hardened** for link and image insertion: URLs are now parsed with the
  real WHATWG `URL` parser (after stripping control/whitespace characters) instead of naive
  substring/prefix checks, closing bypasses like embedded tabs inside a `javascript:` scheme.

### Removed

- `@milkdown/theme-nord` and its bundled Tailwind-based global CSS reset, which was leaking
  unscoped rules (e.g. `h1..h6`, `a`, `ul/ol` resets) into the host model-driven form page
  outside the control's own boundary.
- Theme machinery throughout: manifest property, `index.ts` validation, prop threading,
  `matchMedia`/`auto` logic, dark CSS variable block, and theme toggle UI.

### Performance

- Bundle size reduced via the theme-nord removal, feature deletions, and dependency
  cleanup, on top of switching to a genuine production build (minified, production React,
  no dev eval wrappers). See `docs/INVESTIGATION.md` ("Lightness plan") for measured
  before/after bundle sizes.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- **Major Code Architecture Refactor**: Restructured codebase for improved maintainability
- Main component (`MarkdownEditor.tsx`) reduced from ~2,100 lines to 1,355 lines (36% reduction)
- Extracted reusable React hooks for better separation of concerns

### Added
- **Custom Hooks Architecture**:
  - `useEditorCommands` - Formatting commands (bold, italic, headings, lists, etc.)
  - `useTableOperations` - Table CRUD operations (add/delete rows/columns)
  - `useFindReplace` - Find/replace with highlighting and keyboard shortcuts
- **Shared Types Module** (`types/editor.types.ts`) - Centralized TypeScript interfaces
- **Lazy PDF Export** - PDF libraries loaded on-demand to improve initial load time
- **Templates Module** - Template definitions moved to dedicated file

### Technical
- Removed unused dependencies: @fluentui/react (247 MB savings in node_modules)
- Moved @types/* to devDependencies (build-time only)
- Added `sideEffects: ["*.css"]` for better tree-shaking
- Removed ~20 unused CSS design tokens
- Production bundle: 1.49 MiB (minified)
- Solution zip: ~478 KB

---

## [1.5.9] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- **Zero-lag typing performance**: Completely eliminated typing lag by deferring all processing to after typing stops

### Technical
- Keystroke handler now only sets a timeout (~0.002ms of work)
- All expensive operations (serialization, DOM updates, stats) happen 150ms after typing pauses
- Removed synchronous doc traversal, DOM queries, and React state changes from keystroke path

---

## [1.5.7] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Horizontal scrolling for wide tables**: Tables wider than the container now scroll horizontally

### Changed
- Table cells use `white-space: nowrap` for predictable sizing
- ProseMirror content area has `overflow-x: auto` for scroll support

---

## [1.5.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Theme toggle button**: Sun/moon icon in toolbar to switch between light and dark mode
- **Performance optimizations**: Word/character counts use refs + direct DOM updates (no React re-renders)
- **Improved Dataverse sync**: Better handling of external updates vs user edits

### Fixed
- **Bundle size issue**: Replaced Fluent Weather icons with inline SVGs to avoid pulling in extra icon chunks
- **Production builds**: Must use `npm run build -- --buildMode production` for optimized output

### Technical
- Component wrapped in React.memo with custom prop comparison
- Added `_hasUserEdited` flag to prevent external updates overwriting user content
- Solution zip size: ~477KB (same as v1.5.5)

---

## [1.5.1] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- **Editor not loading Dataverse content on first open**: Added useEffect to sync external value changes to the editor when data loads after the editor initializes. This fixes the issue where users had to refresh the record to see the markdown content.

### Technical
- Editor now watches for `initialValue` prop changes and updates the Milkdown editor content when data arrives from Dataverse after initial render
- Uses ProseMirror parser to convert incoming markdown and replace document content

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- **Fluent 2.0 Visual Redesign**: Complete visual overhaul using Microsoft Fluent 2.0 design language
- **Fluent UI Icons**: All toolbar icons replaced with crisp SVG icons from @fluentui/react-icons
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Subtle backdrop blur on toolbar, dropdowns, and panels
- **Enhanced Shadows**: Multi-layered shadows for depth and professional appearance
- **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients on active buttons, toolbar, and status bar
- **Grouped Toolbar**: Buttons organized into logical visual groups (History, Headings, Formatting, etc.)
- **CSS Design Tokens**: Full token-based theming system for consistent styling

### Changed
- Toolbar icons increased from 18px to 20px for better visibility
- Icon color changed from muted gray to full contrast for clarity
- Added `shape-rendering: geometricPrecision` for sharper SVG rendering
- Dropdown z-index increased to prevent clipping behind editor
- Find & Replace panel right-padded to prevent close button overlap
- Close button reduced from 28px to 24px for better proportions

### Fixed
- Dropdowns no longer appear behind editor content (z-index stacking fix)
- Container overflow changed from hidden to visible for proper dropdown display
- Find navigation buttons now work immediately (no longer requires multiple clicks)
- Screen shake eliminated when navigating find results (instant scroll vs smooth)
- Table display no longer broken by `display: block` CSS rule

### Technical
- Added @fluentui/react-icons dependency (v2.0.315)
- Bundle size increased from ~4.5 MiB to ~7.0 MiB (Fluent icons library)
- Dark theme tokens updated for glassmorphism effects
- Solution renamed from "Solution" to "RSMMarkdownEditor"

---

## [1.4.3] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed
- Rows property now always controls height (no longer overridden by allocatedHeight)
- Increased row height from 24px to 28px to match standard textarea behavior

### Technical
- Height formula: `rows × 28px + 80px` (e.g., 22 rows = 696px)

---

### Added
- **Rows property**: Configurable number of rows to control editor height
- Default: 10 rows (~360px with toolbar)

- Cleaned up dependency tree (removed 82 redundant packages)

### Technical
- Single version of `@milkdown/utils` (7.17.1) now in dependency tree
- Build now works reliably with fresh `npm install`
